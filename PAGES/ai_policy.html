    <h1>AI Usage Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Responsible AI Usage</h2>
    <p>We utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance user experience, provide insights, and automate certain tasks. We are committed to using AI in a transparent, ethical, and responsible manner.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Our AI systems may process anonymized user data to improve the accuracy and relevance of results. We do not sell personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Human Oversight</h2>
    <p>While AI can assist in decision-making, all critical decisions are supervised by human operators. AI is used as a support tool, not a replacement for human judgment.</p>

    <h2>4. Transparency</h2>
    <p>When content or decisions are generated by AI, we aim to clearly indicate that such content is AI-generated or influenced.</p>

    <h2>5. Limitations</h2>
    <p>AI is not perfect. There may be errors or unintended outputs. Users are encouraged to verify AI-generated content, especially in sensitive or critical use cases.</p>

    <h2>6. User Consent</h2>
    <p>By using features powered by AI on our site, you consent to the processing of data as described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about our AI practices, contact us at <a href="mailto:sujithkumar2002k@gmail.com">ai-support@example.com</a>.</p>
